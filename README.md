This repository contains objects of ABAP SDK for Azure. As ABAP is not an open source language, we have shared the code of all the ABAP objets that are used in a text file format. You have to create all of these objects in your system to get started.

Please follow the steps provided in the following documents to install and implement ABAP SDK in your landscape.
1. Installation guide - INSTALLATION GUIDE ON ABAP SDK FOR AZURE V1.0.txt
2. Implementation guide -  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE ON ABAP SDK FOR AZURE V1.0.txt

These documents can be found in the repository along with the source code.

As of version 1.0, ABAP SDK supports native integration of SAP with following Azure services,
1.	Eventhub
2.	Servicebus
3.	Key vault
4.	SQL DB
5.	Active Directory
6.	Blob

Note:  You may find few class methods unimplemented as we are continuously enhancing the ABAP SDK with new features. New updates and changes will be shared in this repository periodically.
